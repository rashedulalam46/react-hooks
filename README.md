# ⚛️ React Hooks Examples

Welcome to **React Hooks Examples**, a collection of simple and practical examples demonstrating how to use React Hooks effectively in modern React applications.

---

## 🚀 Overview

React Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 to allow functional components to manage **state**, **side effects**, and **lifecycle** features — all without using class components. This repository includes examples of common hooks and their real-world use cases.

---

## 🧩 Hooks Covered

Here are some of the hooks demonstrated in this repository:

| Hook | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **useState** | Manage component-level state |
| **useEffect** | Handle side effects (e.g., data fetching, subscriptions) |
| **useContext** | Access context without prop drilling |
| **useReducer** | Manage complex state logic |
| **useRef** | Access or store DOM elements and mutable values |
| **useMemo** | Optimize expensive calculations |
| **useCallback** | Memoize functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders |
| **Custom Hooks** | Create reusable logic shared across components |
